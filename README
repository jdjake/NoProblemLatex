What Is No Problem Latex?
-------------------------

No Problem Latex is a simple program designed to make
setting up latex documents for homework problem sets.
Using intuitive problem enumerations, one can easily
setup a document without taking time to setup the
title, font and date (No Problem Latex sets that up
for you). As a project, No Problem Latex, developers
will attempt to add necessary features without adding
complexity to setting up and compiling a document.

The Latest Version
------------------

Version 1.0, the first version, implements the ability
to enter a title and author name for a homework document,
and using regular expressions to implement various
customizable enumeration styles (default styles include
Numeric, Alphanumeric and Roman Numeral fonts).

How to use
----------

Add your enumerations to an input.txt file, with first line
detailing your name, second line the title of your assignment,
and all further lines detailing the problem numbers for your
assignment. Here's an example:
